title: "Its Time to Build - An (ironic) essay by Marc Andreessen"
description: "The guy (and someone I admire) who coined the term - Software is Eating the World, writing about building physical things is too damn ironic (and hypocritical) to mandate a note."

Marc Andreessen who coined the term ["Software is Eating the World"](https://a16z.com/author/marc-andreessen/){:target="_blank"} and founded a whole movement (and a VC firm that mostly invests in low capital requirement and primarily software companies) [writing on the a16z blog](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/){:target="_blank"} on building physical things. 

>...part of the problem is what we didn’t *do* in advance, and what we’re failing to do now is.. specifically our widespread inability to *build* (physical things).

>We don’t have enough coronavirus tests, or test materials — including, amazingly, cotton swabs and common reagents. We don’t have enough ventilators, negative pressure rooms, and ICU beds. And we don’t have enough surgical masks, eye shields, and medical gowns — as I write this, New York City has put out a desperate call for rain ponchos to be used as medical gowns. Rain ponchos! In 2020! In America!

He mentions Physical things, and not software

>don’t have therapies or a vaccine....but then we may not have the manufacturing factories required to scale their production

He mentions Physical things, and not software


>Making masks and transferring money are not hard. We could have these things but we chose not to — specifically we chose not to have the mechanisms, the factories, the systems to make these things. We chose not to *build*. You don’t just see this smug complacency, this satisfaction with the status quo and the unwillingness to build, in the pandemic, or in healthcare generally.

It's not really a matter of choice but motivations and incentives. And he is one of the reasons why the motivations or investments are not there to *build* these things.


>You see it in education. We have top-end universities, yes, but with the capacity to teach only a microscopic percentage of the 4 million new 18 year olds in the U.S. each year, or the 120 million new 18 year olds in the world each year. Why not educate every 18 year old?

While Tech companies in [which he invests](https://a16z.com/portfolio/){:target="_blank"} in and others focus on hiring people with technical (software and hardware) skills and [without degrees](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/16/15-companies-that-no-longer-require-employees-to-have-a-college-degree.html){:target="_blank"}

>You see it in manufacturing...but why has so much manufacturing been offshored to places with cheaper manual labor? We know how to build highly automated factories...Why aren’t we building Elon Musk’s “alien dreadnoughts” — giant, gleaming, state of the art factories producing every conceivable kind of product, at the highest possible quality and lowest possible cost — all throughout our country? You see it in transportation. Where are the supersonic aircraft? Where are the millions of delivery drones? Where are the high speed trains, the soaring monorails, the hyperloops, and yes, the flying cars?

The skills and programs like [mechanical, manufacturing and industrial engineering required to build these automated factories are dying or dead.](https://www.engineering.com/JobArticles/ArticleID/8530/Engineering-Fields-That-are-Dead.aspx) No kid wants to be a Mechanical Engineer - they want to be like Elon or Marc and *build* software and websites.

>The problem is desire. We need to *want* these things. The problem is inertia. We need to want these things more than we want to prevent these things. The problem is regulatory capture. We need to want new companies to build these things, even if incumbents don’t like it, even if only to force the incumbents to build these things. And the problem is will. 

My respect for this man would have increased exponentially if he would included himself as one of the problems. The problem is Marc and people like him who by writing this article have proven to me that they have no cognitive ability to understand the impact they have. 

>Our nation and our civilization were built on production, on building. Our forefathers and foremothers built roads and trains, farms and factories, then the computer, the microchip, the smartphone, and uncounted thousands of other things that we now take for granted, that are all around us, that define our lives and provide for our well-being. 

Current leaders (Technology and Business) did not follow the forefathers and foremothers and have failed to keep the legacy of building/production alive. They have created an environment in US where words like "startup" and "entreprenuer" does not bring to mind someone with a lathe machine or 3-D printer armed with CAD design but someone with a laptop creating web-apps in React. 

Final Word: My problem is not with the article. Everything (mostly) is absolutely correct. My problem is with the hypocricy, ignorance and sheer irony introduced by simply looking at the person who wrote it - a man who gained prominance and wealth by building one of the first browsers and changing the world and who lives by the mantra "Software is Eating the World".
