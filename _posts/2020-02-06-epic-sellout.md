>Epic Systems CEO Judy Faulkner recently urged some of the largest health systems in the country to sign a letter opposing proposed rules designed to make it easier for patients to obtain their medical information and share it with apps.

>About 60 of these health systems have signed it.

>While we support HHS’s goal of empowering patients with their health data and reducing costs through the 21st Century Cures Act, we are concerned that ONC’s Proposed Rule on interoperability will be overly burdensome on our health system and will endanger patient privacy.

A complete list of these systems who are opposing the rule is at the end of the article

SELLOUTS.

The sliver of hope is that some of the largest healthcare systems have not signed it

>Their absence represents a thundering silence, said David Brailer, the first National Health Information Technology Coordinator, appointed by George W. Bush. Many health systems are quietly discussing how the data access and data fluidity actually benefits them in the long-run.
