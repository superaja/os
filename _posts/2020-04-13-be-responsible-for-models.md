1. 538 predictions are probabilities (likelihood) of an event happening (or not).
2. Their models try to represent real-world but cannot represent uncertainties of the real-world. In other words, they are not well modeled uncertainties and should not sold as such.
3. So if they said x% is the likelihood of something will happen, there is (1-x%) chance that it will not happen. In other words, they are never wrong cause if it did not happen, they would say we told you so that (1-x%) chance it did not happen.
4. The issue is not with their modeling approach. The issue at hand is to sell it to the world as they have the best models and that they can be never wrong - which is a fallacy.

Nassim Taleb called Nate Silver out and Issac Faber has a great piece here.

Issac Faber [writing in Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-you-should-care-about-the-nate-silver-vs-nassim-taleb-twitter-war-a581dce1f5fc){:target="_blank"} on why Taleb (and so should most of us) has concerns about FiveThirtyEight (538) probabilistic statements.

>FiveThirtyEight’s predictions...are reported as point estimates (sometimes with model implied error), well in advance of the event.

>Because FiveThirtyEight only predicts probabilities, they do not ever take an absolute stand on an outcome. In the public eye, they (FiveThirtyEight) are judged on how many events with forecasted probabilities above and below 50% happened or didn’t respectively (in a binary setting). Or, they (the readers) just pick the highest reported probability as the intended forecast.

Silver is sly where he only speak in probabilities of an event. If the event happens in his favor (his projections are on the right side of the decision boundary), he takes full [credit](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1894410_1893209_1893477,00.html){:target="_blank"}. When it fails (his predictions where on the opposite side of the 50% decision boundary), he resorts to ["you do not know how math works"](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1059149034693316608){:target="_blank"}. Ridiculous!

Further ask yourself the question..
>If their model is ignoring some of the most consequential uncertainties, are we really getting a reliable probability?

Cannot agree more on..
>The blog feels more like a slick sales pitch, complete with quantitative buzzwords, than unbiased analysis (though it may very well be). If a prediction does not obey some fundamental characteristics, it should not be marketed as a probability.

>Here we can say, with some confidence that FiveThirtyEight predictions are not always reliable probabilities. However, they masquerade as one, being between 0 and 1 and all. This is Taleb’s primary argument; FiveThirtyEight’s predictions do not behave like probabilities that incorporate all uncertainty and should not be passed off as them.

>...positioning yourself(538) to appear correct regardless of the outcome, making users infer their own decision boundaries, over-reporting of predictions, and ignoring epistemic uncertainty should not be overlooked..

Though Issac in this blog is polite enough to say FiveThirtEight is not a bad craft, I am of the opinion that Silver has always used his one-win (2008 elections - and by the way he did not call out the winner of a single state but just the likelihood of winning) to justify creating a misleading (and highly-read) blog to promote his own position on a basis of his gullible readers. He believes he and models are NEVER WRONG. In other words, he does not take responsibility for his own actions (models).
