title: "Tracking Covid19 - An Analytical Record"
description: "This is probably the first time in history that the entire world is tackling a singular problem created by an invisible enemy. I am recording my work in this blog while following social-distancing. Many folks are doing some great data work on tracking covid19 and its impact and I will link their work here."

**Update: 24th March 2020**

General Commentary: Case Trackers and Maps are limited to determining how the virus is progressing. But none of this is actionable. What really matters at the end of the day is do the following -

* The Hospitalization Statistics by Region that will determine and predict the stress on the system so that the appropriate resources can be diverted on time. 

* Intervention and Outreach by Health Insurance Companies (which has been extremely disappointing) to their most vulnerable population - high morbidity / high risk. The fact is that this information is available to them at their fingertips, but I have yet see any action.

* An Open Data Consortium of Health Insurance, Hospitals, Pharmacies, Tech Companies and other healthcare parties to share COVID-19 related data through a mechanism similar to [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/){:target="_blank"} so that crowd-sourcing of creation of effective actionable analytics and delivery to the the front-lines in real-time can be achieved. This is simply missing.  

* Data and Analytics that help the medical supply chain deliver the equipment needed to the areas most in need. 

The Open Source community is doing much more in this space than the leaders in healthcare.

>We’re inspired to see this community of contributors come together with such a robust response to the COVID-19 outbreak. We are already donating 60,000 computing hours/day to Folding@home, and we’ve reached out to other projects to offer support. 



1. Corrected the Wartime Defence Production Act - The President never executed on it. Disappointing.

2. Updated Tracker and Percent Charts

3. Added US States Tracker

*Confirmed Case Tracker*

{% include image.html path="covid19/confirmed-log-3-24.png" path-detail="covid19/confirmed-log-3-24.png" alt="Confirmed Case Tracker" %}

*Regular Scale*

{% include image.html path="covid19/confirmed-3-24.png" path-detail="covid19/confirmed-3-24.png" alt="Confirmed Case Tracker" %}

US is now on track to probably be the worst effected country by COVID-19 even surpassing Spain due to either increased testing or we are just too late due to inaction.

*Percent of Recovered, Mortality and Yet to Recover by key affected countries*

{% include image.html path="covid19/percent-3-24.png" path-detail="covid19/percent-3-24.png" alt="Percent Recovered" %}

Recovering Rates are increasing in Asia but not the US and European countries - this is not surprising given that the rate of infection has flattened in Asia.

*US State Tracker*

{% include image.html path="covid19/state-confirmed-3-24.png" path-detail="covid19/state-confirmed-3-24.png" alt="State Tracker" %}

New York (especially NYC) has become a runaway case and is now the [epicenter for the US](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/nyregion/Coronavirus-new-York-epicenter.html){:target="_blank} and maybe on track to become the epicenter of the world with [**16,000** confirmed cases and a mortality rate of **1.23%**](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-daily-data-summary.pdf){:target="_blank"}.   


4. Added UW Virology-19 Dashboard - 7.4% Positivity Rate for COVID-19. [South Korea has a positivity rate of 2.65%](https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030){:target="_blank"}, and COVID-19 OSS Help Desk


**COVID-19**

History is in the making. The emergence of the Covid19 virus in Wuhan province in November 2019 coincided with Chinese Lunar New Year holiday. Despite its innocous beginnings, 5 months later 236,000 are confirmed infected and nearly 10,000 dead. This is the first time in human history that the entire world is tackling a single problem created by this invisible enemy. Some countries like [South Korea with its large testing apparatus has got the virus in control](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/coronavirus-cases-have-dropped-sharply-south-korea-whats-secret-its-success){:target="_blank"}, while countries can Iran and [Italy are overwhelmed](https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-latest-news-2020-03-19/){:target="_blank"}. 

Quarantines, social-distancing, remote work and other strategies have been adopted in the US and across the globe to limit the spread of the virus. In short, we as humans have nearly shut down the world economy. The US has slowly started to see the impact of the virus and [is quite ill-prepared](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/us-isnt-ready-whats-about-happen/607636/){:target="_blank"}. Whether we become the Italy or we are South Korea will be decided in the next couple of weeks.

The world is racing to create a vaccine but it may be at least a few months away. Cosmetic companies are changing their processess to create hand-santizers. People are designing much needed ventilators. The genome of the virus has been mapped and shared across world. And Data Scientists and Engineers are doing what they can do - make the best of what data is available to them to try and get an handle on how to track the virus and its impact. THIS IS NOT A MOVIE.  

**Tracking the Impact - with Data**

The most used resource for the impact of the Virus on humans comes from John Hopkins University's [COVID-19 Map](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html){:target="_blank"} and the underlying data fueling the application. It provides the basic statistics. Deeper analysis is as follows. 

*Percent of Recovered, Mortality and Yet to Recover by key affected countries - As of 20th March 2020*

{% include image.html path="covid19/percent-3-20.png" path-detail="covid19/percent-3-20.png" alt="Percent Indicators" %}

As time goes, I would expect higher recovery rates across all the countries due to better intervention and time allowed for recovery and immunity 

*Confirmed Case Tracker - As of 20th March 2020*

{% include image.html path="covid19/confirmed-log.png" path-detail="covid19/percent.png" alt="Confirmed Case Tracker" %}

There are [many versions of this out there](https://covid19dashboards.com/compare-country-trajectories/){:target="_blank"} but I am skeptical of the work. The **Confirmed Case Tracker" is critical enough to justify creating and updating it live. 

The above indicates the growth profile of confirmed cases by the number of days since the 100th case was determined in each country. The result at this point in sobering. The US is looking more like Italy then South Korea. See the <span style="color:red">Red</span> and <span style="color:blue">Blue</span> traces. I have hopes that we will bend this trend by wide-spread tests, physical distancing and smart policy.
