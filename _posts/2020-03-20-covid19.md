**COVID-19**

History is in the making. The emergence of the Covid19 virus in Wuhan province in November 2019 coincided with Chinese Lunar New Year holiday. Despite its innocous beginnings, 5 months later 236,000 are confirmed infected and nearly 10,000 dead. This is the first time in human history that the entire world is tackling a single problem created by this invisible enemy. Some countries like [South Korea with its large testing apparatus has got the virus in control](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/coronavirus-cases-have-dropped-sharply-south-korea-whats-secret-its-success), while countries can Iran and [Italy are overwhelmed](https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-latest-news-2020-03-19/). 

Quarantines, social-distancing, remote work and other strategies have been adopted in the US and across the globe to limit the spread of the virus. In short, we as humans have nearly shut down the world economy. The US has slowly started to see the impact of the virus and [is quite ill-prepared](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/us-isnt-ready-whats-about-happen/607636/). Whether we become the Italy or we are South Korea will be decided in the next couple of weeks.

The world is racing to create a vaccine but it may be at least a few months away. Cosmetic companies are changing their processess to create hand-santizers. People are designing much needed ventilators. The genome of the virus has been mapped and shared across world. The president has [invoked the Wartime Act](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/politics/trump-defense-production-act-coronavirus/index.html). And Data Scientists and Engineers are doing what they can do - make the best of what data is available to them to try and get an handle on how to track the virus and its impact. THIS IS NOT A MOVIE.  

**Tracking the Impact - with Data**

The most used resource for the impact of the Virus on humans comes from John Hopkins University's [COVID-19 Map](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) and the underlying data fueling the application. It provides the basic statistics. Deeper analysis is as follows. 

*Percent of Recovered, Mortality and Yet to Recover by key affected countries - As of 20th March 2020*

{% include image.html path="covid19/percent-3-20.png" path-detail="covid19/percent-3-20.png" alt="Percent Indicators" %}

As time goes, I would expect higher recovery rates across all the countries due to better intervention and time allowed for recovery and immunity 

*Confirmed Case Tracker - As of 20th March 2020*

There are [many versions of this out there](https://covid19dashboards.com/compare-country-trajectories/) but I am skeptical of the work. The **Confirmed Case Tracker" is critical enough to justify creating and updating it live. 

The above indicates the growth profile of confirmed cases by the number of days since the 100th case was determined in each country. The result at this point in sobering. The US is looking more like Italy then South Korea. See the <span style="color:red">Red</span> and <span style="color:blue">Blue</span> traces. I have hopes that we will bend this trend by wide-spread tests, physical distancing and smart policy.
