  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    My place to reflect on Healthcare, Finance and Analytics. The content and opinion on this digital diary and blog are my own and affiliated company (current or future) and do not reflect the opinions of any parties, vendors, employers and people I work with. I decided to create this own blog rather than take advantage of blogging sites as I like the ability for me to control not only my content but the format. I am using [Chalk](http://chalk.nielsenramon.com/) as I like the clean minimalistic format. It is hosted on github pages. I encourage you to pen me @
os@0bsidiansteel.com. In most cases, I will not respond.</p>
